Master bedroom of my 2-bedroom apt. is available!  Great location in Northgate.  2 blocks from the transit center, 3 blocks from I-5!  Convenient for bus riders or if you have a car.  Across the street from Northgate Mall.  There's a ton to do in this area.   
The unit has a deck, fireplace and in-unit washer and dryer set!  No need to save quarters and no trips to the basement!  We have very good wifi as well.   
You'd be sharing the unit with me.  I'm 28-years-old, substitute teacher, graduate student.  I have one more year of grad school left.  This keeps me pretty busy a lot of weeknights, so please no guests past 10PM Sunday-Thursday(weeknights).  Absolutely no smoking in-unit.  Keeping 420 in the apartment is fine, but you must smoke outside.  Best fit would be someone who has their own stuff going on in their lives, but would be down to occasionally cook dinner together/do-takeout, and grab a beer once in a while.   
The apartment is already fully furnished, except for the master bedroom (your room) which is currently empty. Best fit might be someone with not a ton of stuff being brought with them.  I would need a commitment to stay at least 3 months from you, as well as at least 2-weeks notice before the end of the month when you plan to move out.  This part is non-negotiable.   
850 PER MONTH INCLUDES ALL UTILITES.  It's one flat fee that covers rent, utilities, everything.  If you move in after the beginning of January, I can pro-rate that month for you.   
Please don't hesitate to contact with any question, look forward to hearing from you!
